	      http_ping - measure HTTP latency

http_ping runs an HTTP fetch every few seconds, timing how long it takes.
See the manual entry for more details.

Files in this distribution:

    README		this
    Makefile		guess
    http_ping.c		source file
    http_ping.1		manual entry
    port.h		portability defines

To build: If you're on a SysV-like machine (which includes old Linux systems
but not new Linux systems), edit the Makefile and uncomment the SYSV_LIBS
line.  If you're doing SSL, uncomment those lines too.  Otherwise, just do
a make.

Feedback is welcome - send bug reports, enhancements, checks, money
orders, etc. to the addresses below.
